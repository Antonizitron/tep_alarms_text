Gianluca Manca, November 1, 2020, ""Tennessee-Eastman-Process" Alarm Management Dataset", IEEE Dataport, doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/326k-qr90.

Original work used a process proposed by J.J. Downs and E.F. Vogel in 1993 in a publication "A plant-wide industrial process control problem". The Tennessee-Eastman-Process simulates the production of two products (G and H) from four reactants (A, C, D, and E). It includes five major units:
- Reactor
- Condenser
- Vapor/liquid separator
- Recycler compressor
- Product stripper
